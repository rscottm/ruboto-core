require 'ruboto/service'

$context.start_ruboto_service do
  # define what your service does. Directly put any code that you want
  # executed when onCreate gets called. Define the rest of the
  # behavior with handle_ blocks. See the README for more info.

  # Services are complicated and don't really make sense unless you
  # show the interaction between the Service and other parts of your
  # app
  # For now, just take a look at the explanation and example in
  # online:
